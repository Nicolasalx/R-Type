## Project Purpose

This project is a game engine built using an Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture, offering scalability and flexibility for managing game objects and systems. Included around this engine is an existing implementation of the classic R-Type arcade game with a focus on multiplayer gameplay.

## Requirements / Supported Platforms
### Requirements:
There are no dependencies required for users as all necessary components are included in the release.

### Supported Platforms:
- **Linux**
- **Windows**

## Usage Instructions
To use the game engine and play the R-Type implementation, follow these steps:

### Download the Latest Release:
Visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/ManuelR-T/R-Type/releases) of this repository.
Download the appropriate zip file for your operating system (e.g., `Rtype-windows.zip` or `Rtype-linux.zip`).

### Unzip the Downloaded File:
- Windows:
    Right-click the downloaded `.zip` file and select `Extract All...`
- Linux:
    ```bash
    unzip Rtype-linux.zip -d R-Type_Server
    ```
**Note**: If you are a developer, you may want to build the project yourself, you find the tutorial on the [developer documentation](docs/developer-documentation.md#build-the-engine).

### Run the Binaries:

- Client:
    ```bash
    ./r-type_client -i <server_ip> -p <server_port> -pn <player_name>
    ```
    - Example:
        ```bash
        ./r-type_client -i 127.0.0.1 -p 8080 -pn Player1
        ```

    - All arguments accepted:
        ```
        Available arguments:
        -i, --ip (string) [required] : Server IP address
        -p, --port (int) [required] : Server port
        -pn, --player_name (string) [required] : Player name
        -h, --help (bool) [optional] : Print this help message
        ```

- Server:
    ```bash
