## Project Purpose

This project is a game engine built using an Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture, offering scalability and flexibility for managing game objects and systems. Included around this engine is an existing implementation of the classic R-Type arcade game with a focus on multiplayer gameplay.

## Epitech Warning

This is a warning to all epitech students:
We recall you that being a copycat at EPITECH will not bring you any good. Copying is totally banned at EPITECH and by not respecting this rule you can be scolded.

## Requirements / Supported Platforms

### Requirements

There are no dependencies required for users as all necessary components are included in the release.

### Supported Platforms

- **Linux**
- **Windows**

## Usage Instructions

To use the game engine and play the R-Type implementation, follow these steps:

### Download the Latest Release

Visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/ManuelR-T/R-Type/releases) of this repository.
Download the appropriate zip file for your operating system (e.g., `Rtype-{version}-Windows.zip` or `Rtype-{version}-Linux.tar.gz` where `{version}` represents the version of the game e.g., `0.2.0`).

### Unzip the Downloaded File

- Windows:
    Right-click the downloaded `.zip` file and select `Extract All...`
- Linux:

    ```bash
    unzip Rtype-linux.zip -d R-Type_Server
    ```

**Note**: If you are a developer, you may want to build the project yourself, you find the tutorial on the [developer documentation](docs/developer-documentation.md#build-the-engine).

### Run the Binaries

- Client:

    ```bash
    ./r-type_client -i <server_ip> -p <server_port> -pn <player_name>
    ```

  - Example:

    ```bash
    ./r-type_client -i 127.0.0.1 -p 8080 -pn Player1
    ```

  - All arguments accepted:

    ```txt
    Available arguments:
    -i, --ip (string) [required] : Server IP address
    -p, --port (int) [required] : Server port
    -pn, --player_name (string) [required] : Player name
    -h, --help (bool) [optional] : Print this help message
    ```

- Server:

    ```bash
    ./build/r-type_server -p <server_port>
    ```

- Server in debug mode:

    ```bash
    ./build/r-type_server -p <server_port> -d
    ```

- All arguments accepted:

    ```txt
    Available arguments:
    -p, --port (int) [required] : Server port.
    -d, --debug (bool) [optional] : Enable debug mode.
    -h, --help (bool) [optional] : Print this help message
    ```

### Commands

Use the `arrow keys` to **move**

and the `space bar` to **shoot beams**

## Troubleshooting

On some version of windows you might want to install yourself openAl from their [website](https://www.openal.org/downloads/)
