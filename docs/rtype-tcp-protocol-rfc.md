### 1. Introduction

The RType TCP Protocol (RT-TCP) is a custom TCP-based protocol designed to facilitate communication between a server and multiple clients in a multiplayer game system. This protocol is used to manage room creation, user interactions, and game status updates within a game server context. The protocol defines a set of commands exchanged over TCP to coordinate room-based sessions, track user readiness, and manage the transition to game states.

This protocol is independent of any specific platform or programming language, making it suitable for cross-platform multiplayer applications.

### 2. Message Format

#### 2.1 TCP Packet Structure

Each message sent between the server and client is encapsulated in a TCP packet, which follows a consistent structure:

| Field       | Size (bytes) | Description                                         |
|-------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `magic`     | 8            | Magic number identifying RT-TCP protocol (0x5443503e) |
| `size`      | 8            | Size of the entire packet (including the header and data) |
| `cmd`       | 8            | Command identifier (see section 3)                  |
| `data`      | Variable     | Data payload specific to the command                |

- **magic**: A fixed value (0x5443503e), used to verify the packet conforms to the RType TCP protocol.
- **size**: The size of the entire packet, including the command and any associated data.
- **cmd**: The command type, which specifies the purpose of the packet and what data follows.
- **data**: A structured payload associated with the command, containing relevant information (e.g., user ID, room name).

### 3. Commands Overview

Commands in RType TCP are divided into two categories:
1. **Client-to-Server (CL)**: Commands sent by the client to initiate actions.
2. **Server-to-Client (SER)**: Commands sent by the server in response to client actions or to propagate game state updates.

#### 3.1 Client-to-Server Commands

| `CL_CREATE_ROOM`         | 2                | Requests the creation of a new game room    |
| `CL_DELETE_ROOM`         | 4                | Requests deletion of a game room            |
| `CL_JOIN_ROOM`           | 6                | Joins a specific game room                  |

| `CL_NOT_READY`           | 12               | Marks the user as "not ready"               |
| `CL_ROOM_LIST`           | 14               | Requests a list of available rooms          |
